#### Dataset

For this analysis we use `stackloss` dataset, and constains operational data of a plant for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.

```
[,1]	Air Flow	 Flow of cooling air
[,2]	Water Temp	 Cooling Water Inlet Temperature
[,3]	Acid Conc.	 Concentration of acid [per 1000, minus 500]
[,4]	stack.loss	 Stack loss
```

#### Linear Model

Using the available variables a linear model will be created in the form of `response ~ predictor`.
Please use the controls below to show the variables in the plot.
